This is an educational website that I created for my, then, 3 year old son Elijah. 
The first implementation was for him to become familiar with lowercase and uppercase letters,
as well as general navigation of a keyboard.

Elijah is now 4 and the problem sets have expanded to basic math and spelling.


Problem Set 1:
Uppercase letters
 
Problem Set 2:
Lowercase letters
 
Problem Set 3:
Counting

Problem Set 4:
Basic Addition up to 10

Problem Set 5:
Spelling easy 3-5 letter words
